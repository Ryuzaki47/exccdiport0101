/**
 * Single authoritative writer for student account balances.
 *
 * INVARIANT: `accounts.balance` is the ONE source of truth.
 *   - Every balance read goes through `$user->account->balance`.
 *   - This service is the ONLY writer of that column.
 *   - `students.total_balance` has been removed (migration 2026_03_17_000001).
 *
 * Call `recalculate()` after any event that changes the financial position:
 *   - After StudentPaymentService::processPayment / finalizeApprovedPayment
 *   - After StudentFeeController::store / storePayment / update
 *
 * NOTE: Auto-promotion of year_level has been REMOVED from this service.
 * Year-level advancement is admin-driven via the workflow system
 * (students.advance-workflow route → StudentController::advanceWorkflow).
 *
 * The previous promoteStudent() call was incorrect because:
 *   - A student finishes paying 1st Year 1st Sem → balance hits 0.
 *   - They are NOT yet in 2nd Year — they still have 1st Year 2nd Sem.
 *   - Year level is an academic status, not a financial status.
 *   - Tying it to balance created silent data corruption on every full payoff.
