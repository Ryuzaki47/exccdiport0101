     * carried forward from the previous term.
     *
     * For a freshly created assessment (no payments yet) every term's balance
     * will equal its amount and carryover will be zero between terms.
     *
     * Wrapped in a DB transaction — all terms update atomically.
     *
     * FIX (Bug #3): Previously `$carryoverBalance` was read from `$term->balance`
     * immediately after `$term->update([...])`. Eloquent's update() persists to
     * the DB but does NOT refresh the in-memory model, so `$term->balance` still
     * held the OLD value. Every subsequent term's balance was computed from a
     * stale base, causing cascading inflation. The fix is to use the locally
     * computed `$totalBalance` variable instead of re-reading the model.
